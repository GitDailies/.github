## What is GitDailies?

GitDailies is a GitHub App that helps you ship better software, faster.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Working in a busy software team it can be hard to stay up to date with what your team has done
each day.

You have a basic choice between being overwhelmed with too much information, or switching off
notifications and potentially missing important stuff. It's also hard to spot trends over time.

## How GitDailies Helps

GitDailies fixes this using a combination of approaches:

* **Automatic Activity Reports** are the perfect complement to your standups. Make your meetings
data-driven, and more efficient.

* **Pull Request Metrics** reveal bottlenecks in your workflow and ensure feedback loops are effective.

* **Highly Customizable Alerts** replace distracting GitHub notifications. Get alerts for _exactly_
the things that are important to you.

* **Welfare Alerts** help prevent team burnout. Get notified if someone hasnâ€™t pushed code for a 
while, so you can reach out and offer assistance.
